# Neural Dynamic Mode Decomposition
This repository contains codes implemented based on the paper below,

T. Iwata, and Y. Kawahara, "Neural dynamic mode decomposition for end-to-end modeling of nonlinear dynamics", arXiv:2012.06191, 2020.

## Neural DMD
This is the same algorithm implemented by Iwata et al.

## Neural DMD with AutoEncoder(AE)
This algorithm is an improved method that alternates between training AutoEncoder and Neural DMD.
